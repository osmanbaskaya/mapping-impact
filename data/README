Key files:

Key files are formatted according to the senseval-2 format:

  doc-id context-id correct-sense(s)

Although the IDs may be arbitrary (see SemCor for example), we format the IDs to
make it easier to recover where each instance comes from. In our formatting, the
doc-id is a combination of the pseudoword and the pseudosense used to make the
instance, e.g., amphibian::auto.  The instance-id is formatted as the
pseudosense, the line number of the context file from which the instance was
drawn, and the instance number of that sense (i.e., how many instances had been
previously seen).  For example, an instance might be auto.line-15.inst-15.  The
line number and inst number will differ if certain lines are skipped in the file
due to being unable to match the pseudosense occurrence with the specified index
(which is rare).  The correct sense is simply which pseudosense was originally
present.


Instance files:

Each pseudoword has an associated instance file for its key.  This instance file
specifies the corresponding file and line offsets for the instances in the key
file.  Line 1 in the instance file corresponds to the instance at Line 1 in the
key file.  The instance file is formatted as:

  pseudosense-file-prefix line-number column

The file prefix is just the pseudosense, but methods can use the lemmatized or
POS-tagged files as needed.  Column is the column index (0-based) according to
the pseudoword.lem.gz file.  

All lines not listed in the instance file may be used for training systems and
are not used in any part of the key.
