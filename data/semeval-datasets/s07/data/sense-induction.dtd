Answers to a sense induction task may be provided as a table of 
INSTANCEID, CLUSTERID pairs, where INSTANCEID refers to the value
of each "id" attribute of each "instance" element in documents 
conforming to this dtd.  Additionally, answers may be embedded 
in this document in order to distribute "gold standard" corpora or 
to facilitate software processing of all the relevant data.
 -->

<!-- a corpus is divided up by lexical item and is associated
     with a language (should maybe use isoXXX character set encodings) -->

<!ELEMENT corpus (lexelt+)>
<!ATTLIST corpus lang CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!ELEMENT lexelt (instance+)>

<!ATTLIST lexelt item CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--  
Instances must denote exactly one head element, which may have satellites in
the case of (discontinuous) multi word expressions.  Answers will be associated
with the instances by the instances 'id' attribute.

The docsrc and topic attributes may be used to help track and index the source
of the data used for senseval.
