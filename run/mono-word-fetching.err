same sentences: U.S. Customs agents have seized more than $22 million worth of cocaine from a fishing boat and arrested three Dominicans, officials said Friday. Customs agents on air patrol spotted bails being dumped from a 25-foot fishing boat off the coast of Fajardo, on the northeast corner of Puerto Rico, about 10 p.m. Thursday, said U.S. Customs special agent in charge Rafael G. Lopez. The 25-foot boat was followed to Cabo San Juan, where its occupants beached the vessel and tried to flee into the woods. Customs later found the bales contained 1,080 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $22 million. Puerto Rican police apprehended, identified as Felix Sanchez Suarez, 33; Joaquin Carpio Javier, 24; and Ramon Cedeno Espiritu Santo, 28, all of the Dominican Republic. They had not yet been formally charged Friday afternoon. Lopez said more than 2,150 kilograms of cocaine have been seized off Puerto Rico over the last ten days.

The six-year police veteran also shows the problems Tijuana leaders face in cleaning up the force's image. Crossing the line into illicit behavior is a matter of self-preservation for cops in the U.S.-Mexican border city, Oscar says. Money worries from low pay have led Oscar to extort bribes from drivers who want to avoid traffic tickets. Fears about safety sometimes cause him to break into homes illegally to gain the upper hand on criminal suspects. Some of his colleagues fall in deeper, forming alliances with the criminals they are supposed to arrest. ``In the U.S., police often play by the book,'' said Oscar, who worked briefly for the Los Angeles Police Department and spoke on condition he not be fully identified. ``H%P

same sentences: The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday after hitting a three-month high against the Japanese yen, but remained strong enough to help prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rise for the sixth straight trading day. It was the first time since May 1994 that the market had six straight days of gains. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average has surged a total of 2,102.78 points, or 14.52 percent, over the period. Despite its decline, the dollar remained higher than its late Monday level in New York, where its strength was eroded by uncertainty over whether Germany would lower interest rates. Late Monday, the U.S. currency had surged in Tokyo to 87.40 yen, its highest late afternoon rate since March 31. Late Tuesday, it was changing hands at 87.20 yen, down 0.20 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late overnight New York level of 86.93 yen. The dollar ranged between 86.86 yen and 87.24 yen during the trading day. It remained strong on purchases based in part on expectations of a cut in German interest rates, dealers said. Some investors, however, avoided significant moves ahead of the German central bank's regular policy meeting Thursday. The dollar strengthened after the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan both cut interest rates and then intervened in currency markets last week to bolster the U.S. currency's value. Other central banks of industrialized nations also have lowered their lending rates, with the exception of Germany. Lower German rates would tend to diminish demand for the mark and instead could strengthen the dollar. Japan has been hoping for a fall by the yen, whose persistent rise against the dollar in the last couple of years has hurt the Japanese economy, in recession since 1991. A higher yen makes Japanese exports less competitive in price and cuts into the value of exporters' dollar earnings. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 345.53 points, or 2.08 percent, closing at 16,588.19. On Monday, the benchmark index had gained 29.58 points, or 0.18 percent. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first section was up 15.27 points, or 1.16 percent, to 1,321.27. It had risen 6.79 points, or 0.52 percent, on Monday.

The meeting, organized by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, will bring together development experts from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere and international agencies, such as the Organization of American States. Together, the experts will find ways to make their region a model of sustainable development, meaning they would plan their growth and development with the environmental and social impacts factored in. Special attention will be paid on how climatic changes are affecting the shorelines of island-nations and the establishment of a coral reef monitoring network. Rising sea temperatures are killing the single cells of coral reefs, the earth's most climate sensitive ecosystem, causing them to turn white, a phenomenon known as ``coral bleaching.'' Damage to coral reefs affects marine diversity because they serve as food suppliers to many species of fish. The experts will also discuss ways to implement the Plan of Action for Caribbean Development adopted during last year's Global Conference on Development in Barbados and will produce an agenda for development in the region.

same sentences: Dariusz Michalczewski stopped overmatched American Paul Carlo in the fourth round Saturday to successfully defend his WBO light heavyweight crown for the second time. The Polish-born German countered with a left hook, after Carlo missed with own left, buckling the American's knees before he slumped to the canvas with 14 seconds to go in the round. Carlo, a light-hitting left hander, had been tagged several times during the round, leading the referee to halt the bout. The American's record fell to 17-3 with six knockouts. Michalczewski ran his record to 27-0 with 22 knockouts in front of 7,000 spectators. In his last title defense in March, the German battered Roberto Dominguez in a second round knockout _ after the Spaniard floored him in the first round. ``I was caught by surprise, but I learned from that.

He next faces WBO No. 1 challenger Everado Amente July 27 in a mandatory defense.

Russia's 1997 budget allocates some 100 trillion rubles (dlrs 17.8 billion) for the armed forces, but it's not enough, the army's deputy chief of general staff, Col. Gen. Nikolai Pishchev, said. His remarks were reported by the ITAR-Tass news agency. Pishchev said the Defense Ministry estimates that money in the budget for salaries will last no more than eight months. He said training funds have almost dried up. There is no money to stage war games to train regular troops and reservists haven't had any training since 1993, he said. ``The army will soon be unable to ensure the country's defense capability,'' he warned. The complaints are not new. Many experts say funding problems have created a near-catastrophic situation in the demoralized armed forces. (sms/cph)

All of the patients were in stable condition after the surgery. 6 But on Tuesday, the liver recipient's condition had worsened, and he may need another transplant, Kyodo News agency reported. 6 The patient was ``close to the early stages of liver malfunction,'' Kyodo quoted his doctors as saying. 6 His condition improved slightly later in the day, Kyodo said. 6 Meanwhile, the heart recipient was recovering well and may be transferred out of intensive care on Wednesday, the national broadcaster NHK reported. 6 That patient was reportedly eating solid food and responding cheerfully to inquiries about his health. 6 Until 1997, Japan was one of the few countries in the world to ban transplants from donors whose brains had stopped functioning but whose hearts were still beating. 6 Previously, a person was only declared dead after the heart stopped. That made it almost impossible to transplant hearts, livers and certain other organs because they deteriorate very quickly. 6 Japan's only other heart transplant was in 1968. The doctor who performed that operation was accused of criminal wrongdoing, though never charged, a factor contributing to Japan's deep discomfort with organ transplants. 6 Critics accused him of taking an organ from someone who wasn't brain dead and transplanting it into a patient who didn't need it. 6

same sentences: Even though Denmark lost, Michael Laudrup felt his glittering career could not have ended much better. ``It was a great experience, a great way to finish my career,'' Laudrup said after the Danes lost a memorable quarterfinal 3-2 Friday to defending World Cup champion Brazil that many thought was the best game of the tournament so far. ``I haven't realized that my career is over now,'' he said. ``It will take some time ... But it was great propaganda for Danish football tonight.'' Laudrup, 34, one of Europe's top soccer players in the past 15 years, is the only player ever to win league titles for (European) powerhouses Juventus, Barcelona, Real Madrid and his last one with Ajax this season. He was the only remaining player from the Danish 1986 team in Mexico, which beat Scotland, Uruguay and eventual finalist Germany before crashing out 5-1 to Spain in Denmark's only previous World Cup appearance. After an emotional goodbye on La Beaujoire stadium's field in Nantes _ at least half a dozen Danes threw their jerseys to their own loyal fans in the stands instead of swapping with the Brazilians _ Laudrup was the last player to leave the locker-room. Any regrets of leaving soccer? ``No way,'' he said. ``In only three weeks a lot of players will gather for training camps with their club teams. Just imagine doing that again, training twice a day! But it was OK for the World Cup, of course.'' Laudrup, Denmark's most famous striker ever, is unique in many ways. Ajax tried to sign him when he was a 13-year-old wonder boy. ``No thanks, too early,'' said his dad Finn, a former Danish national team player with foreign experience in the Austrian league. After the Dutch side failed to sign Laudrup at age 13, he started his career in his native Denmark with Brondby, the first team to be listed on the Danish stock exchange. After a stint with FC Copenhagen, Laudrup went to Juventus in 1983. He had a spell on loan to Lazio in Rome for two seasons before returning to ``Juve'' and winning the '86 league title alongside Michel Platini. In Spain, Laudrup became a league champion four straight times (1991-94) with Barcelona before leaving for rival Real Madrid, where he won a fifth straight title in 1995. After a year in Japan with Vissel Kobe, he returned to Europe and Ajax, capping it with the recent Dutch double (league and cup). In the early 90s, both Michael and his younger brother Brian refused to play for their country at one point under former coach Richard Moller Nielsen. Only Brian played in the 1992 European Championship finals in Sweden, where Denmark upset Germany 2-0 in the final for its only major international triumph. Encouraged by new Swedish coach Bo Johansson's less rigid approach to tactics, the Laudrup brothers were back to their best in France '98. Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal as Denmark beat Nigeria 4-1 Sunday to reach the quarterfinals for the first time, set up Martin Jorgensen's opening goal with only two minutes gone Friday and notched the equalizer 2-2 early in the second half. After ending his remarkable career, Laudrup will return to Denmark with his family.

same sentences: If there's one thing there's not a shortage of this holiday season, it's hip-hop releases. What there is a shortage of, though, is good hip-hop releases. And when we say good, we don't mean rap's same ol', same ol', which is: discs filled with gunfire, woman-bashing, I'm-so-great-bow-before-me posing, ya-better-buy-my-records threats and endless tales of how fine the high-life is and how horrible it must be to live without stacks of money, garages full of limos and an endless posse of girls, girls, girls. That stuff got old about, oh, five years ago. So it's incredibly refreshing when a hip-hop artist refuses to go with such a shallow flow, and for the past few years, Long Island rapper Nas (mom calls him Nasir Jones) has done just that, crafting records with down-to-earth lyrics and strong, memorable melodies. And, unlike Will Smith, Puff Daddy and other top-drawer hip-hop stars, Nas doesn't rely solely on samples, although he does his share of pop-catalog pilfering. Yet for the most part, Nas is somewhat of a hip-hop outsider, which, thankfully, he proves once again on ``Nastradamus,'' his second effort this year (back in April, he released the equally good ``I Am ...''). Here you will find very little posing, very little misogyny and very few samples _ you just get a lot of great hip-hop. In Nas' case, this means you get stories about looking at life through the broken window of an apartment in the projects. You see your friends die (''Shoot 'Em Up''), grow up and move on (''Some of Us Have Angels'') or stay behind (''Life We Chose''). Never once does Nas bash or condone gang life (although he does attack drug use); he simply raps about the chaos swirling around him; he's not pro- or anti-anything, just an observer. And the mellow-voiced singer wraps these observations around different styles of music, from the soulful balladry of ``Project Windows'' (that's Ron Isley singing backup) to the jazz-tinged ``Life We Chose,'' which stylishly samples Maceo Parker's ``Peace Fugue.'' In between, there are nods to pop and rock, making ``Nastradamus'' an overwhelmingly eclectic listen _ and an intelligent one, as well.

As part of a plan to fight urban sprawl, Clinton is expected to announce that $1 billion a year will be available to buy open space. By KATHLEEN INGLEY. Story will move in the ``A'' category.  60 MINUTES-TV (Pasadena, Calif.) - ``60 Minutes'' has been often imitated, never duplicated. Until tonight, when the first officially sanctioned clone of the veteran CBS newsmagazine comes to life. Call it sensible commerce or yet another sign that broadcast networks have reached rock-bottom idea bankruptcy, but the coming of ``60 Minutes II'' brings the newsmagazine saga full circle. Story moved in the ``E'' category.  VANZANDT-SOPRANOS (Undated) - Were he not real, Miami Steve Van Zandt could've been one of the oddball Jersey Shore characters who populated Bruce Springsteen's early songs. An E Street reunion tour is in the works for later this year, and Van Zandt will be on board. But he's also participating in what is sure to be one of 1999's entertainment highlights. In the brilliant new 13-hour HBO miniseries, ``The Sopranos,'' Van Zandt plays Silvio Dante, a lesser mobster who aspires to be more than the colorful manager of a Jersey girlie joint. By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E'' category.  GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ I wasn't going to let it happen this year, but before I knew it, I was missing snow again. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ.

same sentences: WHAT IT MEANS: The Jets will have to give up the No. 1 pick in the June draft, which also happens to be the top pick overall, if they want Parcells as their coach in 1997. Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning, if he chooses to declare for the draft, is considered one of the top prizes, along with Ohio State offensive tackle Orlando Pace. The Patriots' own pick is No. 29.   BILL PARCELLS  WHAT HE SAID: ``I have chosen not to extend my contract with the New England Patriots ... Right now I'm sitting out. I'm not allowed to coach this year unless it's with the Patriots, the commissioner rendered that decision. I don't know what I'm going to do.''  WHAT IT MEANS: If the Jets can work out adequate compensation with Patriots owner Bob Kraft, Parcells will become their head coach, and probably general manager as well, for 1997. If no agreement can be reached, Parcells could do television work for a year, after which he'd be free to pursue any NFL coaching job.
